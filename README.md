# GitHub Actions

This is a repository with different GitHub Action templates to implement depending of your CI/CD needs.

## Description

Different configurations to implement CI/CD to your projects using GitHub Actions.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* A GitHub account with a repository holding your code
* An AWS Account and a role with the required access to deploy the resources. There are different ways to provide access to the GitHub actions entity in AWS. For better security a token based approach is preferred but you can even use your own AWS account with key/secret authentication. Such keys should be stored as secrets in GitHub instead of hardcoded in the yaml config files.

### Installing

* Integrate your GitHub account with AWS -> https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/integrating-with-github-actions-ci-cd-pipeline-to-deploy-a-web-app-to-amazon-ec2/
